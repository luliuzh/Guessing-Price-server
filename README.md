## High-level components üìå
<a name="high-levelcomponents"></a>
### 1. User

The User component represents the core participants of our game ‚Äì the players. Beyond standard functionalities like login and registration, users can initiate game sessions, prepare for gameplay, submit answers, purchase tools, and earn points throughout the game. This component encapsulates all user-related interactions within the system.

[User](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/entity/User.java)
[User Service](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/UserService.java)

### 2. Room

The Room component serves as the container for all in-game activities, defining the fundamental parameters of gameplay such as game mode, player count, and point allocation. Within a room, a specific game mode is selected, and multiple rounds of gameplay can unfold, fostering a dynamic and immersive gaming environment.

[Room](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/entity/Room.java)
[Room Service](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/RoomService.java)

### 3. Question

Questions form the backbone of gameplay, encapsulating vital information such as item images, price ranges, and tool effects tailored to individual players and game rooms. Each question represents a pivotal moment in the game, providing players with essential data to make informed guesses. A game comprises multiple questions, each containing one or several items for assessment.

[Question](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/entity/Question.java)
[Question Service](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/QuestionService.java)

### 4. Answer

The Answer component manages the receipt and processing of players' guessed prices, incorporating logic to calculate earned scores based on various game modes and room conditions. Players can submit only one answer per question, and once all answers within a round are collected, the accumulated scores are disseminated for ranking within the room.

[Answer](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/entity/Answer.java)

 ### 5. EbayService

The EbayService component facilitates interaction with the eBay API to retrieve item information, necessitating configurations such as credentials, search scopes, and request types. This service acts as the bridge between the game and external data sources, enriching the gaming experience with real-world market insights and item details.

[EbayService](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs24/service/EbayAPIService.java)

## Launch & Deployment :technologist:
<a name="launchanddeployment"></a>
### 1. Gradle Setup

To build and develop the application locally, you'll need to set up Gradle. You can use the Gradle Wrapper provided in the project:
-   macOS &  Linux: : `./gradlew`
-   Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

For more detailed information, refer to the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/docs/).

#### Build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

#### Run

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

You can verify that the server is running by visiting `localhost:8080` in your browser.

### 2. Development Mode
You can start the backend in development mode, this will automatically trigger a new build and reload the application
once the content of a file has been changed.

Start two terminal windows and run:

`./gradlew build --continuous`

and in the other one:

`./gradlew bootRun`

If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:

`./gradlew build --continuous -xtest`

### 3. API Endpoint Testing with Postman
We recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) to test your API Endpoints.

### 4. Test
You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### 5. Ebay API
The application utilizes the eBay API. 

For more details, refer to the [eBay API documentation](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/buy/browse/resources/item_summary/methods/search#s0-1-22-6-7-7-6-SearchforItemsbyCategory-1)

You may need to apply for authorization to use the eBay API, which you can do [here](https://developer.ebay.com/)


### 6. Database
The application uses the H2 database. Configuration details can be found [here](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-18/sopra-fs24-group-18-server/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties)


### 7. Deployment on Google Cloud
The application is hosted on [The Price Is Right](https://sopra-fs24-group-18-client.oa.r.appspot.com/)

The Google Cloud Projects are as following:

[Server Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/services?serviceId=default&project=sopra-fs24-group-18-server)
[Client Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/services?serviceId=default&project=sopra-fs24-group-18-client)

To join the projects, please contact lu.li@uzh.ch.

## Roadmap :bulb:
<a name="roadmap"></a>
### 1. Expand User Tools :placard:
Our current set of user tools is limited, but there's significant potential for enhancement. For instance, tools to extend the guessing time, or tools allow collaboration among players.

### 2. More Game Modes :roller_coaster:
While our project currently offers two game modes, there's room for expansion to enrich the gaming experience. For example, modes that allow players to choose specific item categories for guessing, or modes that contain more competitive challenges.

### 3. Enhance Features :star2:
Although our project primarily focuses on the core gameplay experience, there's potential to incorporate additional features to further elevate user engagement. Such as background music (BGM) to enhance the atmosphere, customizable game room backgrounds to personalize the experience, and built-in communication tools to facilitate interaction among players during gameplay sessions.
